HAKA Runtime
============

Haka-Runtime is a tool that allows to capture TCP/IP packet and filter
them based on Lua policy files in a wireshark fashion.

Major features:

  - Capture/Drop packet using nfqueue 
  - Read packet either from a pcap file or from interface using libpcap
  - Filter packet from Lua policy files using wireshak-like expressions
  - Log using either stdout or syslog modules
  - Provide accessors to TCP and IP headers fields
  - Forge TCP and IP headers packet
  - And more features coming soon ...

    $ sudo apt-get install swig

    - Doxygen

    $ sudo apt-egt install doxygen

    - Lua

    $ sudo apt-get install liblua5.1
 
    - tshark

    $ sudo apt-get install tshark
 
    - libpcap

    $ sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

Build
-----

It is highly recommanded to create a separate directory (`mkdir make`) to store
all the files generated during the build using cmake

    $ mkdir make
    $ cd make
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[build type] ..

	where build type can take one of the following values:

   - Debug  
   - Release
   - RelWithDebInfo
   - MinSizeRel

then use make like usual to compile (`make`) and install (`make install`) or
clean (`make clean`)

Usage
-----

### Basic Usage

    $ ./haka <luafile.lua>
	
	where haka is a binary located at $HAKA\_HOME\_DIR/make/out/bin

	Note: you should have root priviledges to run some lua files 
    (ie. listening on interfaces)

### Lua sample file
    
    Sample lua files are given in $HAKA\_HOME\_DIR/tests/sample

Tests
-----

run `make test` to play some unit tests. 

Documentation
-------------

run `make doc` to generate doxygen documentation in `html` and `latex` format.
Documenation is available in $HAKA\_HOME\_DIR/make/Documentation

Packaging
---------

run `make package` to get a tar.gz archive of the whole project

Files
-----

  - src: haka app. source files
  - include: header files shared between haka app. and haka modules
  - modules: module source files (these modules will be loaded by haka app.)
  - lib: shared libraries
  - build: cmake scripts for the build
